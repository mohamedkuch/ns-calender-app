# ns-calendar-app
This calendar application was developed as part of a 48-hour technical challenge to demonstrate my proficiency with NativeScript and Angular. The app is designed specifically for iPad and enables users to manage and view property schedules with a clean and responsive UI.
## Key Technologies


- **NativeScript with Angular:** Framework for building native iOS and Android apps using Angular.
- **NgRx Store:** State management for efficiently handling app data and user interactions.

## Project Overview

The app provides an intuitive interface for scheduling property viewings, showing detailed information about each viewing, and allowing users to manage viewings in a simple calendar layout. 

The application was developed within a 48-hour timeframe, with a focus on delivering both functionality and a polished UI.
